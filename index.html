    <h1>No one should have to suffer through a hopeless diagnosis, which is why we want widespread detection of pancreatic cancer while it is in its most treatable stage.
    </h1>
    <h2>Located in sunny San Diego</h2>
    <p>Our premier product we have become known for is the Prophecy assay. This tool allows our patients to have the best odds in the fight against pancreatic cancer. In the past it has been hard to diagnose pancreatic cancer until it has progressed past a point of being easily treatable, due to the internal location of the pancreas. However, with the ability of Prophecy to pick up on trace amounts of circulating tumor DNA, pancreatic cancer can be diagnosed earlier than ever before. Early diagnostics increase treatment options for our patients and save thousands of lives.
